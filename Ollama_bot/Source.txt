Symptoms
Diagnosis
Takeaway
Headaches are a common health problem that most people experience at some time.

Factors that lead to headaches may be:

emotional, such as stress, depression, or anxiety
medical, such as migraine or high blood pressure
physical, such as an injury
environmental, such as the weather
Frequent or severe headaches can affect a person’s quality of life. Knowing how to recognize the type of headache and its cause can help a person take appropriate action.

Types
Some of the various kinds of headaches include:

Tension-type headache (TTH)
This is the most common form of headache, affecting three-fourths of the general population. Tension-type headache was previously called muscle contraction headache. It is associated with the muscles of the neck, face, and jaw.

A 2020 study found that TTH is closely related to stress.

A person with TTH may feel:

as if they have a tight band around their head
a constant, dull ache on both sides of the head
pain spreading to or from the neck
Tension-type headaches may be episodic or chronic. Episodic attacks usually last for a few hours, though they can last for several days. When TTHs occur on 15 or more daysTrusted Source per month for at least 3 months, they are considered chronic.

Learn more about tension-type headaches.

Migraine
Migraine is the third most common and the seventh most disabling illness globally. Based on a 2021 survey, it affects almost 16%Trusted Source of the U.S. population.

A migraine headache may involve pulsating, throbbing pain. It often occurs on one side of the head but may switch sides.

During an episode, a person may also experience:

lightheadedness
sensory disturbances, such as changes in vision, known as an aura
sensitivity to light or sound
nausea, possibly with vomiting
Migraine headaches are the second most commonTrusted Source form of primary headache after TTH. They can significantly impact quality of life.

A migraine episode may last from 4–72 hoursTrusted Source when untreated or unsuccessfully treated. The frequency of episodes can vary greatly, but many people have two to four migraine episodes in a month.

Learn about migraine triggers here.

Medication overuse headache (MOH)
Also known as rebound headaches and medication-misuse headaches, this type occurs in people who take medications to treat their headaches too often.

People with primary headache disorders like migraine often develop medication overuse headaches. These can cause migraine episodes to occur more frequently and become more severe.

Instead of alleviating symptoms, the medications cause headaches and increase their intensity and frequency. MOHs tend to result from taking opiate-based medications, such as those that contain codeine or morphine.

Beyond the headache, a person may experience:

neck pain
restlessness
a feeling of nasal congestion
reduced sleep quality
The location, severity, and frequency of MOHs vary from person to person, but they often occur daily or nearly daily and are present upon waking up. MOH can cause dull pain like a tension headache to more severe pain similar to a migraine headache.

Cluster headache
These headaches usually last between 15 minutes and 3 hours, and they may occur one to eight times per day.

Cluster headaches may frequently arise for 4–12 weeks, then disappear. They tend to happen at around the same time each day.

Between the clusters, the person may have no symptoms. These remission periods may last months or years.

Cluster headaches often involve brief but severe pain around or behind the eye on one side of the face. This pain can radiate to other parts of the face.

Learn more about headaches behind the eyes here.

The following may accompany a cluster headache:

red or watery eyes
drooping or swollen eyelids
blocked or runny nose
a smaller pupil (constricted) in one eye
sweating on the forehead
Find out more about cluster headaches.

Thunderclap headache
These are sudden, severe headaches that people often describe as the worst headache of their livesTrusted Source. They reach maximum intensity in about 30 seconds to a minute and slowly fade within a few hours.

A thunderclap headache is a secondary headache that can indicate a life threatening condition, such as:

an aneurysm
reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome
meningitis
pituitary apoplexy
bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage)
blood clot in the brain
People who experience these sudden, severe headaches should receive immediate medical care.

Learn more about thunderclap headaches.


Causes
A headache can affect any part of the head, and pain may be present in one or several locations. Headaches also cause various types of pain. Classifying the pain can help a doctor reach a diagnosis.

Doctors also categorize headaches based on whether an underlying health condition is responsible for the pain. In other words, a headache may be primary or secondary, notes the International Headache Society.

Primary headaches
A primary headache is not a symptom of an underlying illness. Instead, these headaches result from problems involving the structures of the head and neck.

A primary headache may be due to overactivity of — or problems in — pain-sensitive structures in the head, including:

specific areas of the brain
blood vessels
muscles
nerves
brain chemicals
Common primary headache disorders include migraine, cluster, tension, and medication overuse headaches.

Secondary headaches
This form of headache is a symptom of an underlying medical condition. The cause of a secondary headache may be:

pregnancy
systemic conditions, such as an infection
hypothyroidism
giant cell arteritis
stroke
brain tumor
According to an article in Practical Neurology, secondary headaches that occur during pregnancy are often caused by underlying conditions like eclampsia and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

Secondary headaches can result from serious health issues. A 2019 studyTrusted Source lists red flags that are considered life threatening and require immediate attention:

neurological symptoms like seizure, loss of consciousness, and confusion
fever
thunderclap headaches
headache worsened by coughing, sneezing, or exercise
headache occuring in those with a history of tumors
being above 50 years old
It is also important for a person to seek medical advice if their headache:

is severe or disruptive
is persistent
occurs regularly
does not improve with medication
occurs alongside other symptoms, such as confusion, fever, sensory changes, or sudden neck stiffening
Treatment
Rest and pain relief medication are the main treatments for headaches.

Options include:

over-the-counter pain relief medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
prescription pain relief medications
preventive medication for specific conditions, such as migraine
other treatments for underlying conditions
It is crucial for a person to follow their doctor’s guidance to prevent medication overuse headaches.

Treating medication overuse headaches involves reducing or stopping the medication. A doctor can help develop a plan to ease off the medication safely. In extreme cases, a person may need a short hospital stay to manage withdrawal safely and effectively.

Alternative and integrative treatments
Several alternative forms of headache treatment, now known as integrative treatments, are available. However, it is important for a person to consult a doctor before making any significant changes or beginning new treatments.

Some of these approaches include:

acupuncture
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
herbal and nutritional health products
hypnosis
meditation
A 2021 study found acupuncture therapy to be more effective than medications in treating chronic tension-type headaches, similar to the findings of a 2018 study. Meanwhile, a 2020 studyTrusted Source found that using CBT decreased the frequency of migraine in children and adolescents.

Some evidence has suggested that migraine episodes may be more likely to occur when a person has low levels of magnesiumTrusted Source and vitamin DTrusted Source. While the evidence is not conclusive, a person may find that taking 400–500 milligrams of magnesium oxide per day helps prevent episodes.

Nutrient deficiencies may result from the quality of a person’s diet, malabsorption issues, or other medical conditions.

Learn more about using magnesium to treat migraine.

Home remedies
Certain care strategies can help prevent headaches or ease the pain. A person may try:

using a heat or ice pack against the head or neck, but avoiding extreme temperatures and never applying ice directly to the skin
avoiding stressors whenever possible and using healthy coping strategies for unavoidable stress
eating regular meals, taking care to maintain stable blood sugar levels
getting enough sleep by following a regular routine and keeping the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet
exercising regularly to boost overall health and lower stress
limiting alcohol intake and drinking plenty of water
taking breaks when working to stretch and prevent eye strain

Symptoms
The characteristics of a headache — and the effects on daily life — can vary. A headache may:

affect one or both sides of the head
radiate from a central point
involve sharp, throbbing, or dull pain
have a vise-like quality
come on gradually or suddenly
last from under an hour to several days
The features of the pain depend, to some extent, on the type of headache.

Is it a headache or migraine episode? What is the difference?

Diagnosis
A doctor can usually diagnose a type of headache after asking the person about:

their symptoms
the type of pain
the timing and pattern of attacks
In some cases, the doctor may perform or request tests to rule out more serious causes of head pain. The tests may involve blood samples or imaging, such as a CT or MRI scan.

0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 0%
Takeaway
Many people experience a headache at least once in their lives. While commonly not a cause for concern, some headaches may be too disabling and severe, affecting a person’s daily life.

Anyone who experiences severe or reoccurring headaches should consult a doctor or otherwise receive professional care.

WHAT IS MINDFUL EATING? YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO ENJOYING YOUR FOOD MORE

What is Mindful Eating? Your Complete Guide to Enjoying Your Food More
When’s the last time you took a moment to actually enjoy a meal? Not just cook something and turn on Netflix, but actually sit down, appreciate the food in front of you, and pay attention to the flavor.

In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life and lose sight of the simple pleasures, like enjoying a delicious meal.

This is where mindful eating can help.

What is Mindful Eating?
Mindful eating entails fully engaging in the present moment and maintaining an awareness of your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations as you eat your food.

It’s about focusing on the experience of eating, savoring each bite, and paying attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues. This approach encourages a deeper connection with your food, the environment, and yourself.

Mindful Eating vs. Dieting
The primary distinction between mindful eating and dieting is that the former focuses on the quality of your eating experience, while the latter centers around restricting certain food groups or counting calories.

Mindful eating is not a custom weight loss plan; instead, it promotes a healthy and balanced relationship with food, free from guilt or deprivation.

Benefits of Mindful Eating
The benefits of mindful eating are numerous, including improved digestion, better management of emotional eating, and increased satisfaction from meals.

Additionally, mindful eating has been linked to reduced binge eating, improved weight management, and overall enhanced mental and emotional well-being.

By practicing mindful eating, you’ll be able to enjoy your food more and establish a nurturing, sustainable approach to nourishment. [1][2]

Principles of Mindful Eating
Here are some of the guidelines for mindful eating and what you can expect to get out of them.

Cultivate the Right Space
Design a space that promotes relaxation and focus during mealtimes. This could involve setting the table with attractive dinnerware, lighting candles, or playing soft background music.

By establishing a peaceful ambiance, you’ll be more inclined to eat mindfully.

Listen to your Body
It all starts with listening to your body.

One of the core principles of mindful eating is tuning in to your body’s natural signals for hunger and satiety.

By paying close attention to these cues, you can avoid overeating and develop a healthier relationship with food.

Mindful Eating Exercises and Meditation
Before eating, take a moment to meditate or practice deep breathing to bring your attention to the present moment.

Practice Portion Control
Overeating often results from consuming large portions outside the norm of a healthy meal plan.

To encourage mindful eating, serve yourself smaller portions and consider using smaller plates to trick your brain into thinking you’re eating more.

If you’re still hungry after finishing your initial portion, wait a few minutes before deciding if you need seconds, allowing your body to register fullness.

Eat Slowly and Savor
Mindful eating encourages taking your time to chew and enjoy every mouthful.

Eating slowly not only enhances the flavors and textures of your food but also allows your body to recognize when it’s full, preventing overeating.

Focus on the Senses
Engaging all your senses while eating helps deepen your appreciation for the meal.

Pay attention to the colors, smells, textures, and flavors of your food, and take the time to acknowledge the work and resources that went into creating your meal.

Appreciate Your Food
Cultivating gratitude for the food you eat fosters a sense of connection with the environment and the people involved in producing it.

This practice encourages you to make more conscious, sustainable food choices and promotes a greater sense of overall well-being.

10 Steps to Mindful Eating
Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to practice mindful eating:

Find a quiet and comfortable space: Choose a location with minimal distractions where you can focus on this mindful eating exercise.
Prepare a small portion of food: Select a small piece of food, such as a raisin, a piece of chocolate, or a slice of fruit.
Observe the food: Take a moment to look at the food, noticing its shape, color, and texture.
Engage your sense of smell: Bring the food close to your nose and inhale its aroma, paying attention to any sensations it evokes.
Take a small bite: Place the food in your mouth and take a small bite, but don’t chew yet. Notice the taste and texture on your tongue.
Chew slowly: Begin to chew the food slowly, savoring the flavors and textures as you break it down.
Pay attention to your body: As you chew, focus on any sensations or reactions your body experiences in response to the food.
Swallow mindfully: When you’re ready, swallow the food and pay attention to the sensation of it moving down your throat and into your stomach.
Reflect on the experience: After swallowing, take a moment to reflect on the entire eating process, considering the sensory experience and any emotions or thoughts that arose.
Repeat: Practice this mindfulness eating exercise with different types of food to develop a deeper appreciation for the various tastes, textures, and aromas each food offers.
Overcoming Common Challenges
To manage emotional eating, recognize your triggers and develop healthy coping strategies.

Resist external pressures to eat mindlessly by setting boundaries and communicating your intentions.

Stay committed to mindful eating by reminding yourself of its benefits, practicing self-compassion, and celebrating small victories in your journey towards a healthier relationship with food.

THE ROLE OF NUTRITION IN CHRONIC DISEASE
Previous Next
View Larger Image
The Role of Nutrition in Chronic Disease
You’ve heard it so many times that it’s become cliché, but that doesn’t make it any less true: you are what you eat. No where is this truer than with nutrition and chronic disease.

Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, are long-lasting health conditions that persist and often require ongoing medical attention or management.

These conditions have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, posing significant challenges to both individuals and healthcare systems.

The Connection between Nutrition and Chronic Disease
Sure, these numbers are going up, but where does nutrition fall into all of this? Is it both the cause and the treatment?

And how can a personalized nutrition plan help all of this?

Let’s take a look at the role of poor nutrition and chronic disease.

The Impact of Poor Nutrition
Poor nutrition can contribute significantly to the development of chronic diseases as well as overall health issues.

Consuming excessive amounts of unhealthy foods, especially those containing added sugars, preservatives, additives, and processed salt, can dramatically increase the risk of various health issues.

What’s more, a lack of essential nutrients can weaken the body’s immune system and hinder its ability to function optimally.

Examples of Nutrition-Related Chronic Diseases
Here are some of the most common chronic diseases that are caused or fueled by poor nutrition choices:

Obesity: A major risk factor for other chronic conditions, obesity is often a result of consuming excessive calories and lacking physical activity. A balanced diet, combined with regular exercise, can help prevent and manage obesity.

Type 2 Diabetes: This chronic condition is strongly linked to poor nutrition, as excessive sugar and carbohydrate intake can lead to insulin resistance. A balanced diet, rich in fiber and low in refined sugars, can help prevent and manage type 2 diabetes.

Heart Disease: Unhealthy eating habits, such as consuming high levels of sugar, processed fats, and cholesterol, can contribute to heart disease. Adopting a heart-healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, can reduce the risk of developing heart disease and help manage existing conditions.

Alzheimer’s Disease: Some recent studies suggest a strong connection between the nutritional choices we make and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Diets that are high in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats while lacking essential nutrients are thought to accelerate cognitive decline. On the flip side, a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and other brain-supportive nutrients found in whole foods can potentially slow the progression of this disease and improve cognitive health.

The Importance of a Well-Balanced Diet
A well-balanced meal plan is crucial in both preventing and managing chronic diseases.

By providing the body with the proper healthy nutrients, a balanced diet supports optimal functioning and helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing the risk of developing health complications.

For those already diagnosed with chronic conditions, a well-balanced diet can alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve overall quality of life.

Key Nutrients and Their Impact on Chronic Disease
Nutrition can be confusing, but you don’t need to be a registered dietician to understand the basics of the key nutrients and the influence they have on your health.

Macronutrients and Micronutrients
Macronutrients and micronutrients are the two essential types of nutrients our body needs to function properly.

Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which provide the energy necessary for our bodies to carry out daily activities.

Micronutrients, on the other hand, consist of vitamins and minerals, which are required in smaller amounts but play vital roles in maintaining overall health.

Role of Key Nutrients in Health and Chronic Disease Prevention
A balanced intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients is essential for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases.

For example, consuming adequate amounts of proteins helps build and repair tissues, while healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, can improve heart health.

Micronutrients like vitamins and minerals support the immune system, bone health, and various metabolic processes.

Nutrients for Managing Specific Chronic Conditions
Here are some of the most important nutrients that can have a direct impact on your health, depending on which chronic condition you have or you’re at risk for.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Heart Disease: Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, flaxseed, and walnuts, have been shown to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of heart disease. Consuming these healthy fats can help manage heart-related conditions by reducing blood pressure and triglyceride levels. [1]

Fiber and Type 2 Diabetes: A diet rich in fiber can help manage type 2 diabetes by slowing down the absorption of sugars and improving blood sugar control. Foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes are excellent sources of fiber and can be incorporated into a diabetes-friendly meal plan. [2]

Potassium and Hypertension: Potassium is an essential mineral that helps regulate blood pressure by balancing the effects of sodium in the body. Consuming potassium-rich foods, such as bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados, can aid in managing hypertension and reducing the risk of stroke. [3]

Calcium and Osteoporosis: Calcium is vital for maintaining bone health and preventing conditions like osteoporosis, which is characterized by weak and brittle bones. Incorporating calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified plant-based milk, can help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. [4]

Magnesium and Migraines: Magnesium is involved in various bodily processes, including nerve function and muscle relaxation. Some studies have shown that magnesium supplementation may help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. Foods rich in magnesium include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dark chocolate. [5]

Nutritional Strategies for Prevention and Management
Here are some nutritional strategies to prevent and manage certain chronic diseases:

Incorporating Heart-Healthy Foods
Consume omega-3 rich fish, such as salmon and mackerel, to reduce inflammation and improve heart health.

Choose whole grains, like brown rice and whole wheat bread, to increase fiber intake and maintain healthy cholesterol levels.

Opt for healthy fats, including olive oil, avocados, and nuts, to replace trans fats.

Managing Blood Sugar Levels
Focus on low-glycemic foods, like non-starchy vegetables and legumes, to prevent blood sugar spikes.

Incorporate high-fiber foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, to promote better blood sugar control.

Practice portion control and mindful eating to maintain a healthy weight and prevent insulin resistance.

Supporting Bone Health
Prioritize calcium-rich foods, including dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified plant-based milk, to strengthen bones and prevent osteoporosis.

Include vitamin D-rich sources, such as sunlight exposure, fortified foods, or supplements, to enhance calcium absorption and support bone health.

Boosting Immune Function
Consume a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, rich in antioxidants and vitamins, to support the immune system.

Include probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt and fermented vegetables, to promote a healthy gut microbiome and enhance immune function.

Reducing Inflammation
Choose anti-inflammatory foods, such as berries, leafy greens, and fatty fish, to combat chronic inflammation and support overall health.

Limit the intake of processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to inflammation and exacerbate chronic conditions.

Understand Your Nutrition with Us
When it comes to understanding nutrition, it can feel like an impossible task because there’s so much information. What’s more, most of it is either misleading or flat out wrong.

Our expert team of nutritionists and dieticians can help you with all of your concerns.

Fresh Blogging Statistics You Need to Know 
Before we jump into some key influencers in the fitness blogging world, let’s break down some of the latest blogging statistics. It feels like blogging as a form of content marketing has been around for a while. It went through a brief moment out of favor, but it’s making a serious comeback.

Blogs have evolved over time into a well of users that fitness bloggers can then direct to different information and resources. For example, a fitness blogger might write an article on pullups, and then provide a video or PDF with all the information the user needs to get started themselves.

Think of blogs as the lobby to the fitness gym, directing you to the resource or room you need to get fitter and improve your workout routine.

Over Half of Online Traffic Comes from Organic Search
According to Bright Edge, organic search remains the dominant source of web traffic, coming in at 53.3%. This shows that organic search is still a valuable marketing strategy. By focusing on SEO and building content that boosts organic search results, you can see how blogging still has a significant role to play in content marketing.  

The Average First Page Result on Google Contains 1,447 Words
On the first page of results on Google, the average word count is 1,447. Longer content tends to accumulate more backlinks than shorter posts, which is beneficial in getting your page higher on search pages. Longer form blogs are also a great opportunity to position your business as an authority in the fitness industry. 

77% of Users on the Internet Read Blogs Regularly 
More than three-quarters of internet users read blogs regularly, covering several niches and industries. No matter how big or small your business, blogging is a good way to establish trust and authority in your industry. Today, it’s more important than ever to combine visual elements with your written content such as video and high-quality photos. 

The Built To Grow Fitness Podcast is a great resource for content marketing strategies. In particular, how to repurpose content so that you can keep your audience engaged all year long. The episode touches on evergreen offers, retargeting content, and the importance of branding.

What Makes a Fitness Blog Successful? 
Some of the best fitness blogs have a massive following. They are a go-to source for all things health, fitness, and well-being. But how do they gain such a big following and what strategy do they use to produce such captivating content? Let’s take a look at what features make a fitness blog successful. 

They Solve a Problem 
A great blog solves a problem. Often people seek out information to solve a problem in their life. For example, a fitness blog that helps mothers work out throughout pregnancy and focuses on post-natal health and fitness is helping to solve a specific issue. Having a niche is super beneficial in all areas of your business and content. When your service or offer solves a problem, it provides more value to your target audience. 

Engages and Connects with the Reader 
Some of the most successful blogs don’t just educate and inform readers, they create content that engages and connects with the reader. Information is delivered in a way that the reader can understand and relate to. Not only do readers find a solution to a problem, but it’s done in a personal and sometimes humorous way. 

Has a Strong Social Media Presence 
Fitness bloggers tend to have a strong social media presence. They continue to interact and engage with users off and on the blog. Social media is a great way to give readers a glimpse behind the scenes and allow the relationship between blogger and reader to grow. Often, fitness bloggers use social media the same way businesses do as a way to grow their brand, expand their reach, and engage readers. 

A great blog takes time to develop; it doesn’t happen overnight. The most popular fitness blogs have grown over the last few years with consistent quality content and a ton of dedication. You’re probably thinking is it worth starting your own fitness blog? The answer is 100% yes.
